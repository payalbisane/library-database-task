# üìö Library Management System - Database Schema

This project is a part of the **SQL Developer Internship Task 1**. It involves designing a normalized relational database schema for a Library Management System using SQL and visualizing it through an ER Diagram.

---

## ‚úÖ Domain
**Library Management System**

---

## üéØ Objective
To create a well-structured and normalized relational database schema that includes all essential entities of a library and their relationships.

---

## üß± Entities and Tables

| Entity        | Description                                |
|---------------|--------------------------------------------|
| `Authors`     | Stores details about book authors          |
| `Books`       | Stores book information                    |
| `Members`     | Library members who can borrow books       |
| `Librarians`  | Staff who manage loan records              |
| `Loans`       | Tracks borrowed books and return info      |

---

## üîó Relationships

- One **Author** can write many **Books**
- One **Book** can be borrowed multiple times by **Members**
- Each **Loan** is recorded and managed by a **Librarian**

---

## üóÉÔ∏è Database Design

### üîπ SQL Script File
The `schema.sql` file contains all the DDL commands to create the database and tables with appropriate constraints such as:
- `PRIMARY KEY`
- `FOREIGN KEY`
- `AUTO_INCREMENT`
- `NOT NULL` and `UNIQUE`

### üîπ ER Diagram
The `er_diagram.png` file shows the visual layout of the schema, created using [dbdiagram.io](https://dbdiagram.io).

---

## üíæ Files Included

| File             | Description                           |
|------------------|---------------------------------------|
| `schema.sql`     | SQL commands to create all tables     |
| `er_diagram.png` | Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD)     |
| `README.md`      | Project explanation                   |

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools Used

- MySQL Workbench / dbdiagram.io
- SQL (DDL)
- Git & GitHub

---

## üì• How to Use

1. Clone the repo or download the files.
2. Open MySQL Workbench and run `schema.sql`.
3. Use the ER diagram to understand table relationships.
